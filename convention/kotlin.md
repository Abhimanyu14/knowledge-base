# Kotlin Coding Conventions

This is the coding conventions I follow in all my projects.  
This is highly opinionated and by no means is menat to be intended as the best practices. It works for me to move faster and not think about aspects like project strcuture, naming, etc.

Some of the core aspects for the basis of the conventions.

1. Uniformity over use-case based decision.
2. To reduce thinking as much as possible over debatable aspects.
3.

4. Always use named parameters when possible.
5. Modifier should always be the first parameter in Composables
6. Always use trailing commas
7. Every file should end with a blank line
8. M3 components should not be used directly
9.

## Ordering

### Sealed class

1. Data objects
2. Data class
3. Sealed class
