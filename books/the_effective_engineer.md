# Chapter 3: Prioritize Regularly

- Prioritize high RoI activities regularly.

- Identifying high leverage activities

  - What directly produces value
  - Important and non-urgent tasks.

- Track To-Dos in a single, easily accessible list.

  - Human brain is optimized for processing and not for storage.
  - Is there something else I could be doing that's higher=leverage?
  - If not, continue the current task.
  - The goal is to continiously shift your top priorities toward the ones with highest leverage, instead of establishing a total ordering of all your priorities.

- Focus on What Directly Produces value
- Focus on the Important and Non-Urgent

- Categorize tasks into Urgent vs Important basis.

|                   | Urgent                 | Not Urgent                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Important**     | OPI, Deadlines         | Planning, New Oppurtunities, Learning, etc. |
| **Not Important** | Slack, Meetings, Mails | Other non productive tasks                  |

- Protect Your Maker's Schedule

  - Block focus time in calendars.
  - No meetings days
  - Shift interruptions close to start/end of focus time blocks.

- Limit the amount of Work in Progress

  - Try to avoid working on multiple projects at the same time
  - Reduce context switches

- Fight Procastination with If-Then Plans

  - Link tasks to help with initial activation energy/motivation.
  - Add time estimate for smaller tasks in the todo lists to trigger if-then for smaller time chunks.

- Make a Routine of Prioritization
  - Regularly reprioritize in progress tasks as required.
